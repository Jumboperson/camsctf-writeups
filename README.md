## ReadMe ##

This repository was created for the purpose of detailing how to solve all the camsctf RE problems.

Mainly to attempt to show how Reversing-2 to Reversing-8 can all be solved in nearly identical fashions.

### Tools ###

The tools I use in these writeups are:

- **IDA 6.6 Pro:** A disassembler that has very limited issues. Often regarded as state of the art.

- **x64 DBG:** A debugger that I find very useful and nice. I prefer this to OllyDBG.
